# Underground Transport
A Factorio 2.0 mod that provides ports to transfer items through an auto-routed, underground transportation network. It is especially helpful for modular logistics on large space platforms.

## Features
- Supports mismatched input and output belt speeds
  - Helpful for scenarios such as multiple slow belt inputs feeding a single high-speed output
- Balances multiple inputs and outputs evenly using round-robin
- Configurable output lanes, facilitating compact and efficient belt utilization
- Supports blueprinting and copy/paste of ports
- Can be used to span gaps in space platforms

## Notes
1. Each surface has its own distinct network - items do not route between surfaces
1. Items have realistic travel times for balance
